## About

This is Wails 2.0 + ReactJS Template
Tested on Windows and MacOS

To create a project using this template run:
`wails init -n [Your Appname] -t https://github.com/AlienRecall/wails-react-template`

## Building 

To build this project use `wails build`.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Wails will watch and re-build for every backend (golang) changes.

## Known Issues

Sadly I still not found a way to correclty run frontend in development mode so the only solution is to rebuild at every frontend change (if you got a way open a pull request thanks)
